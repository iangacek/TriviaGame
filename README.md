# TriviaGame

### Overview

The Trivia Game is a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery Trivia application which utilizes question timers which reset after every question. The questions are based off a video game I played for many years.

### Organization

This application primarily functions from the `game.js` file located in the `javascript` folder, using an array of questions with answers, along with numerous jQuery functions.

## Instructions

The game will immediately begin once the web page is loaded, starting the 15 second countdown timer. To answer a question, simply click the corresponding answer you believe is correct. The application will either time out after 15 seconds and mark the answer as incorrect, or will inform you if your answer is correct/incorrect.

At the end of the game, the application will tally your correct answers, while also providing a list of the correct answers.
